# StoneEdge
The game's main repo. Not for prototypes.

# IMPORTANT NOTES
**DO NOT (YET) ADD HEAVY ASSETS SUCH AS :**
- Images;
- 3D models;
- Audio files;

... Because the space in this repo is limited and Git is not really suited
for these anyway. We'll find another way, such as FTP on our own websites,
automated via shell scripts.

The Unity version is `2017.1.0x`.
